## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### Investor Pitch Messaging

**One-Liner**: "Miyabi is the only autonomous development system with mathematical convergence guarantees, solving the #1 barrier to enterprise AI adoption: reliability."

**Differentiation vs. Competitors**:
| Competitor | Their Weakness | Our Strength |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Line completion only | Full project automation |
| **Devin** | No mathematical foundation | Proven convergence (Theorem 5.1) |
| **AutoGPT** | Not production-ready | Enterprise-grade (SOC 2, 94.7% success) |
| **Cursor** | Requires human in loop | Fully autonomous agents |

**Unfair Advantages**:
1. 2 peer-reviewed papers (6-12 month moat)
2. Rust implementation (10x speed)
3. Japan beachhead (less competition, warm intros)
4. Open-source core (community network effects)

---

## RISK MITIGATION SUMMARY

### Top 5 Risks & Mitigations

**1. GitHub Copilot Launches Agents** (70% likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Stay 12-18 months ahead, enterprise depth (compliance), mathematical differentiation

**2. Economic Recession** (40% likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: ROI messaging (78% cost savings), flexible pricing, Japan focus (counter-cyclical)

**3. SWE-bench Performance Lags** (30% likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: ML team hire, weekly benchmarking, pivot to reliability messaging

**4. Devin Gets $100M+** (50% likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Geographic separation (Japan), scientific positioning (papers), partnership exploration

**5. Claude API Dependency** (15% likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Multi-LLM architecture (GPT-4 fallback), on-premise option, strategic partnership
