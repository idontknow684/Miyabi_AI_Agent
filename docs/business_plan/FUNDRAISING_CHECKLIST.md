## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Fundraising Stalls (No Term Sheet by Jan 31) 🚨

**Plan A: Extension (30 days)**
- Expand outreach to 30 more VCs
- Lower valuation ask ($10M post instead of $12M)
- Consider smaller round ($2M instead of $3M)

**Plan B: Alternative Funding**
- Accelerator application (YC, Antler, 500 Global)
- Revenue-based financing (if ARR > $300K)
- Strategic investment (KDDI, NTT as lead)

**Plan C: Bootstrapping**
- Focus on revenue (convert PoCs aggressively)
- Cut costs (no hires until profitable)
- Delay Series A to Month 24

### If PoCs Fail (0/3 convert to paid) 🚨

**Analysis**:
- Is it product (not working)?
- Is it pricing (too expensive)?
- Is it timing (budget cycles)?

**Mitigation**:
- Deeply interview failed PoC customers
- Adjust product (fix top 3 issues)
- Adjust pricing (offer discount for early adopters)
- Pivot to SMB if enterprise too slow
