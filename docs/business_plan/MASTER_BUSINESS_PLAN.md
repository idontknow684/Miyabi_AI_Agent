## 7. RISK ANALYSIS

### 7.1 Technical Risks

#### Risk T1: SWE-bench Performance Fails to Reach Top 10%

**Likelihood**: Medium (30%)
**Impact**: High (valuation risk, competitive disadvantage)

**Description**: Despite mathematical proofs, real-world benchmark performance lags due to dataset bias, evaluation criteria mismatch, or implementation bugs.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Dedicated ML team**: Hire ex-OpenAI/Anthropic engineer (Month 6)
2. **Continuous evaluation**: Weekly SWE-bench runs, track progress
3. **Alternative benchmarks**: Diversify to HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests
4. **Academic collaboration**: Partner with Stanford/MIT for eval methodology
5. **Fallback messaging**: Emphasize mathematical convergence > benchmark gaming

**Contingency**: If Top 10% not achieved by Month 12, pivot messaging to "proven reliability" over "benchmark leader."

#### Risk T2: Claude API Dependency (Vendor Lock-In)

**Likelihood**: Low (15%)
**Impact**: Medium (cost increase, service disruption)

**Description**: Anthropic raises prices, degrades service, or discontinues API access.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Multi-LLM architecture**: Maintain OpenAI GPT-4 fallback
2. **On-premise LLM option**: Integrate LLaMA 3 for air-gapped deployments
3. **Strategic partnership**: Negotiate long-term contract with Anthropic (Month 6)
4. **Cache optimization**: Reduce API calls by 40% via intelligent caching
5. **Fine-tuned models**: Train smaller models for routine tasks (θ₁, θ₂)

**Contingency**: If Claude unavailable, GPT-4 cutover takes <24 hours (tested quarterly).

#### Risk T3: Rust Ecosystem Maturity (Burn Framework)

**Likelihood**: Medium (25%)
**Impact**: Low (dev velocity slowdown)

**Description**: Burn ML framework lacks features (e.g., distributed training), forcing rewrites or workarounds.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Contribute to Burn**: Become major open-source contributor (commit 10% eng time)
2. **Fork if needed**: Maintain internal fork with custom features
3. **Python bridge**: Use PyO3 to integrate PyTorch/TensorFlow for advanced features
4. **Hiring**: Prioritize engineers with Rust + Python dual expertise

**Contingency**: If Burn inadequate, migrate to PyTorch with Rust bindings (3-month effort).

#### Risk T4: Convergence Failures in Production

**Likelihood**: Low (10%)
**Impact**: High (customer churn, reputational damage)

**Description**: Despite theoretical proofs, edge cases cause infinite loops, incorrect outputs, or crashes.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Iteration limits**: Hard cap at 50 iterations (Theorem 5.1 predicts <20)
2. **Timeout mechanisms**: 30-minute max per task
3. **Fallback to human**: Escalate to support if convergence fails
4. **Monitoring**: Alert on convergence failures (SLA: <1% of tasks)
5. **Continuous learning**: Feed failures into training corpus (θ₆)

**Contingency**: Offer "money-back guarantee" for tasks that fail to converge.

### 7.2 Market Risks

#### Risk M1: Economic Recession Reduces IT Budgets

**Likelihood**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: High (slower customer acquisition, pressure on pricing)

**Description**: Global recession (2026-2027) causes enterprises to freeze hiring, cut tool budgets.

**Mitigation**:
1. **ROI-focused messaging**: Emphasize cost savings ($78K/year per dev)
2. **Flexible pricing**: Offer monthly billing, no long-term contracts
3. **Downgrade paths**: Allow Enterprise → Team tier (retain revenue)
4. **Efficiency story**: "Do more with less" resonates in recession
5. **Government contracts**: Target public sector (counter-cyclical)

**Contingency**: Extend runway by cutting OpEx 30% (delay Series A by 6 months).

#### Risk M2: Developer Shortage Abates (Market Shrinks)

**Likelihood**: Very Low (5%)
**Impact**: Medium (reduced urgency to buy)

**Description**: AI coding tools flood market, solving shortage; or economic downturn reduces software demand.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Diversify value props**: Beyond shortage → quality, speed, compliance
2. **Pivot to DevOps**: Automate Ops, SRE, QA (adjacent markets)
3. **Global expansion**: Shortage persists in emerging markets (India, Brazil)

**Contingency**: N/A (extremely unlikely; shortage projected to worsen to 2030).

#### Risk M3: Open-Source Alternative Emerges

**Likelihood**: Medium (35%)
**Impact**: Medium (price pressure, differentiation challenge)

**Description**: Community forks AutoGPT, adds Miyabi-like features; free alternative erodes pricing power.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Open-source core strategy**: Commoditize complements (we already do this)
2. **Enterprise features**: SSO, RBAC, compliance non-replicable by OSS
3. **Managed service**: Hosting, support, SLA (OSS can't match)
4. **Network effects**: Our system improves with usage (data moat)
5. **Talent advantage**: Full-time team > part-time contributors

**Contingency**: Accelerate open-source strategy; position as "Enterprise-grade AutoGPT."

### 7.3 Competitive Risks

#### Risk C1: GitHub Copilot Launches Agent Features

**Likelihood**: High (70%)
**Impact**: High (distribution advantage, brand pressure)

**Description**: Microsoft/GitHub adds autonomous agents to Copilot; leverages 100M+ developer user base.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Speed to market**: Stay 12-18 months ahead (we're already agents, they're completion)
2. **Enterprise depth**: Compliance, security, auditability (Copilot lacks)
3. **Mathematical differentiation**: Emphasize convergence proofs (marketing moat)
4. **Integration strategy**: Offer "Copilot + Miyabi" bundle (partnership)
5. **Vertical focus**: Go deep in finance, healthcare (Copilot too horizontal)

**Contingency**: If Copilot launches agents, pivot to "Copilot for enterprises who need guarantees."

#### Risk C2: Devin Secures $100M+ Funding, Scales Aggressively

**Likelihood**: Medium (50%)
**Impact**: Medium (market validation helps us; competition intensifies)

**Description**: Devin raises mega-round, hires aggressively, grabs market share.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Geographic separation**: Japan-first (Devin US-focused)
2. **Scientific positioning**: We have peer-reviewed papers; they don't
3. **Enterprise vs. Dev**: We target CTOs; they target developers
4. **Partnership exploration**: Explore acquisition/merger (complementary strengths)
5. **Talent poaching**: Recruit their engineers (Miyabi more research-oriented)

**Contingency**: If Devin dominates US, double down on Japan + Europe.

#### Risk C3: Anthropic/OpenAI Launches Competing Product

**Likelihood**: Medium (40%, within 24 months)
**Impact**: Very High (existential threat)

**Description**: Foundation model providers vertically integrate into autonomous agents.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Partnership strategy**: Position as enterprise layer for their models
2. **Speed**: Capture 100+ customers before they enter (switching costs)
3. **Specialization**: Go deep in verticals (they stay horizontal)
4. **Acquisition target**: Make Miyabi attractive acquisition (grow fast, strategic fit)
5. **Multi-LLM support**: Stay model-agnostic (not locked to Claude/GPT)

**Contingency**: If they launch, negotiate acquisition at 3-5x ARR multiple.

### 7.4 Operational Risks

#### Risk O1: Founder Departure / Key Person Risk

**Likelihood**: Very Low (5%)
**Impact**: Very High (company dissolution risk)

**Description**: Shunsuke (solo founder) leaves, becomes incapacitated, or loses motivation.

**Mitigation**:
1. **CTO hire**: Months 6 (shares technical leadership)
2. **Documentation**: SWML, Flickering Scenery fully documented (transferable IP)
3. **Key person insurance**: $2M policy (Month 6)
4. **Succession plan**: CTO as interim CEO if needed
5. **Vesting**: Founder shares vest over 4 years (alignment)

**Contingency**: Board (post-Series A) has authority to appoint interim CEO.

#### Risk O2: Hiring Velocity Fails to Meet Plan

**Likelihood**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: Medium (product delays, sales misses)

**Description**: Rust engineer shortage, compensation non-competitive, or remote-first culture unappealing.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Competitive comp**: 75th percentile salaries + equity
2. **Global hiring**: Remote-first = access to worldwide talent
3. **Employer branding**: Publish research, sponsor conferences (attract top talent)
4. **Recruiting firm**: Engage Triplebyte/Hired for engineer sourcing (Month 6)
5. **Contractor fallback**: Use fractional CTOs, contract engineers (short-term)

**Contingency**: If hiring lags, slow product roadmap (prioritize core features).

#### Risk O3: Data Breach / Security Incident

**Likelihood**: Low (10%)
**Impact**: Very High (reputational damage, regulatory fines, customer churn)

**Description**: Customer code/data leaked due to vulnerability, insider threat, or supply chain attack.

**Mitigation**:

2. **SOC 2 compliance**: External audits (Month 12)
3. **Bug bounty**: HackerOne program ($500-$10K rewards, Month 9)
4. **Incident response plan**: Tabletop exercises (biannual)
5. **Cyber insurance**: $2M coverage (Month 12)
6. **Encryption**: All customer data encrypted (at rest + in transit)

**Contingency**: If breach occurs, activate IR plan (contain, notify, remediate within 72 hours).

#### Risk O4: Regulatory Changes (AI Compliance)

**Likelihood**: Medium (50%, within 36 months)
**Impact**: Medium (compliance costs, feature restrictions)

**Description**: EU AI Act, US AI regulation, or industry-specific rules (FinTech, healthcare) impose restrictions.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Proactive compliance**: Implement explainability, auditability now (not later)
2. **Policy engagement**: Join AI policy advocacy groups (Partnership on AI)
3. **Regulatory monitoring**: Dedicated compliance role (Month 12)
4. **Geographic flexibility**: If EU restricts, focus on US/Japan
5. **Competitive advantage**: Compliance costs favor well-funded startups (hurts competitors)

**Contingency**: If regulation severe, lobby for reasonable implementation timelines; pivot to compliant markets.

### Appendix B: Customer Interview Insights

*Conducted 12 interviews with Japanese CTOs/VPs of Engineering (Oct-Nov 2025)*

**Pain Points** (Ranked by frequency):
1. **Developer shortage** (12/12 mentioned): "We have 40 open positions unfilled for 9+ months"
2. **Legacy modernization** (9/12): "$15M budget to migrate monolith to microservices, need 5 years"
3. **Onboarding time** (8/12): "New engineers take 6-12 months to be productive"
4. **Code review bottleneck** (7/12): "Senior devs spend 40% of time reviewing junior code"
5. **Documentation debt** (6/12): "Half our codebase has zero docs, only 2 people understand it"

**Willingness to Pay**:
- $100-200/user/month: 3/12 ("Budget constrained")
- $200-400/user/month: 7/12 ("ROI justifies it")
- $400+/user/month: 2/12 ("If it truly works, price doesn't matter")

**Decision Criteria** (Top 3):
1. **Reliability**: "Must work 95%+ of the time, we can't afford failures"
2. **Security**: "Code is our IP, needs enterprise-grade security"
3. **ROI**: "Show me time saved in hours/week, I'll calculate the value"

**Objections**:
1. **Trust**: "How do I know AI won't introduce bugs?" → Mitigation: Mathematical proofs, audit logs
2. **Job displacement**: "Will this make our developers redundant?" → Mitigation: "Augmentation not replacement"
3. **Vendor lock-in**: "What if you go out of business?" → Mitigation: Open-source core, data portability

### Appendix C: Financial Model (Spreadsheet Description)

*To be created in Google Sheets / Excel*

**Tabs**:

1. **Assumptions**: All inputs (pricing, costs, growth rates)
2. **Revenue Model**: Customer cohorts, MRR/ARR buildup
