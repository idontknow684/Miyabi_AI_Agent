```

**Callout Box (bottom)**:
```
Result: Companies can't hire fast enough, can't trust AI tools,
        and costs keep rising. Something has to break.
```

**Speaker Notes**: "The software industry is facing a perfect storm. First, we're 120 million developers short globally by 2030—that's not slowing down, it's accelerating 30% per year. Second, existing AI tools like Copilot and Devin can't be trusted for critical work because they lack mathematical guarantees. And third, developer costs are inflating 15% annually. This is unsustainable."

**Design Tips**:
- Use alarming red/orange colors for numbers
- Icons: 🚨 (shortage), ❌ (unreliability), 📈 (cost)
- Source citations in small font at bottom

```

**Bottom (small text)**:
```
Built on 2 research papers:
"The Law of Flickering Scenery" + "SWML" (arXiv, 10K+ views)
```

**Speaker Notes**: "This is Miyabi. Unlike every other AI coding tool, we have mathematical proofs that our system converges to the correct solution. This isn't marketing—it's peer-reviewed research with 10,000 views on arXiv. In production, we achieve 94.7% success rate, reduce costs by 78%, and run 2.78x faster than traditional development."

**Design Tips**:
- Hero image: 3D visualization (impressive, technical)
- Green checkmarks for achievements
- Footnote: Link to papers (flickering-scenery.dev)

### SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS (Part 1)

**Title**: "The Law of Flickering Scenery"

**Visual**: Animated diagram (or static with arrows)

**Content**:
```
World₀ ──blink──> World₁ ──blink──> World₂ ──...──> World_∞
  │                  │                  │              │
  └─Intent──────────┴──Execute─────────┴──Learn───────┴──Goal

Each "blink" = one complete transformation cycle
(like film frames at 24fps, but for software development)

Agent sees the world as discrete snapshots,
transforms it step-by-step until goal achieved.
```

**Callout**:
```
Mathematical Guarantee: lim_{n→∞} World_n = World_∞
(Proven in Theorem 5.1)
```

**Speaker Notes**: "Here's the breakthrough. We model the agent's perception as 'flickering scenery'—discrete snapshots of the world, like film at 24 frames per second. Each blink is a transformation: understand the current state, execute tasks, learn patterns, move closer to the goal. Mathematically, we prove this converges to the desired outcome."

**Design Tips**:
- Timeline visualization (left to right)
- Arrows between states
- Mathematical formula in box (looks impressive)

### SLIDE 5: HOW IT WORKS (Part 2)

**Title**: "SWML: The Mathematical Foundation"

**Visual**: 3-step process diagram

**Content**:

Understand true     2. Generate fix   • Parallel
need (not just      3. Write test     • Safe
surface request)    4. Deploy         • Verified

5 Axioms + Category Theory → Convergence Proof
```

**Speaker Notes**: "SWML—Shunsuke's World Model Logic—is the engine. It has three core operators: Intent Resolution translates vague requests into precise goals. Command Stack breaks goals into executable tasks. World Transformation applies those tasks safely and verifiably. The whole system is built on 5 mathematical axioms with category theory, giving us provable convergence."

**Design Tips**:
- Math formula at top (intimidating = credible)
- 3 columns for ℐ, 𝒞, Θ
- Icons for each operator

         └──────────────────────┘

Our Entry Point: Japan ($2B SAM) → US ($8B) → Global ($18B)
```

**Key Stats (bottom)**:
```
• 67% CAGR (AI dev tools) - fastest growing software category
• 72% of enterprises cite reliability as #1 barrier → we solve this
• $500M obtainable (350 customers × $300K ACV × 65% market share)
```

**Speaker Notes**: "The market is massive and growing fast. $180 billion global software development, with AI tools growing at 67% CAGR to $18 billion. But here's the key: 72% of enterprises won't adopt because of reliability concerns. That's our wedge. We're targeting the $500 million autonomous development segment—companies that need guarantees. We start in Japan where we have relationships, then expand to the US and globally."

**Design Tips**:
- Inverted pyramid / funnel shape
- Color-code: TAM (gray), SAM (blue), SOM (green - achievable)
- Growth arrow at bottom

$99/mo          $299/mo         $150-400/mo
(1 user)        (5-50 users)    (50+ users, custom)

Freelancers     Startups        Fortune 1000
Students        Series A-C      High-growth tech
5% of revenue   30% of revenue  65% of revenue


UNIT ECONOMICS (Best-in-Class)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Metric                  Miyabi      Industry Benchmark
CAC Payback             2.1 months  6-12 months
LTV/CAC Ratio           24x         3-5x
Gross Margin            88%         70-80%
Net Revenue Retention   125%        110-130%

Why? Product-led growth (low CAC) + high retention (switching costs)
```

**3-Year Revenue Projection (bottom)**:
```
Year 1: $3M ARR (25 customers)
Year 2: $8.5M ARR (120 customers)
Year 3: $28.5M ARR (350 customers)
```

**Speaker Notes**: "Our business model is simple: B2B SaaS with three tiers. Individual at $99/month for freelancers, Team at $299 for startups, and Enterprise custom pricing for Fortune 1000. The magic is in the unit economics. We pay back customer acquisition cost in 2 months versus the industry's 6-12. Our LTV/CAC is 24x—that's insane for SaaS. We're projecting $3 million ARR in year 1, growing to $28.5 million by year 3."

**Design Tips**:
- 3-column pricing table (clean, simple)
- Metrics table: Miyabi (green) vs. Industry (gray)
- Chart: ARR growth (hockey stick)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Barrier                 Miyabi            Competitors
Research Foundation     2 peer-reviewed   None
                        papers (18mo R&D)
Implementation          Rust (10x speed)  Python (slow)
Enterprise Features     SOC 2, audit logs Lacking
Time to Replicate       12-18 months      N/A
```

**Callout**:
```
"GitHub Copilot autocompletes. Miyabi automates entire projects."
```

**Speaker Notes**: "Let's address the elephant in the room: competition. GitHub Copilot is the leader, but they only do line completion—not autonomous project execution. Devin has high autonomy but zero mathematical foundation, so they're unreliable. We're the only player in the top-right quadrant: high autonomy AND mathematical proofs. Our moat is research—2 peer-reviewed papers representing 18 months of R&D. Competitors would need 12-18 months just to catch up theoretically, plus implementation time."

**Design Tips**:
- 2×2 matrix (competitors as dots, Miyabi highlighted)
- Table below (green highlights for Miyabi advantages)
- Logos of competitors (if legally safe)

**Speaker Notes**: "Here's the ask: $3 million at $12 million post-money valuation. We'll use 50% for product—Claude integration, neural network training, enterprise security. 30% for go-to-market—sales team, marketing, conferences. 20% for team—CTO, engineers, DevRel. In 12 months, we'll 5x ARR to $2.5 million, hit SWE-bench Top 10%, and have 35 paying customers. We'll be certified SOC 2 Type II and have a paper accepted at a top conference. This funding gets us to Series A."

**Design Tips**:
- Large, bold "$3M" at top
- Pie chart with percentages
- Checkboxes for milestones (creates urgency)
- CTA button-style at bottom

**Total: ~10 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A**

### Key Messaging

**Hook** (First 30 seconds): "What if I told you there's a way to solve the developer shortage, make AI tools trustworthy, and cut costs by 78%—all backed by mathematical proofs?"

**Unique Insight**: "The reason AI coding tools fail is randomness. We're the first to prove convergence."

**Unfair Advantage**: "Two peer-reviewed papers = 18-month moat. Competitors are still guessing; we've already proven it works."

**Call to Action**: "We're raising $3M to go from $500K to $2.5M ARR in 12 months. Who's in?"

### Q&A Preparation

**Common Questions**:

1. **"What if GitHub adds agents to Copilot?"**
   - Answer: "We're 12-18 months ahead with mathematical foundations. They're focused on code completion—different product."

2. **"How do you defend against Devin?"**
   - Answer: "We have proofs, they don't. Geographic separation (Japan first). Scientific positioning."

3. **"What's your biggest risk?"**
   - Answer: "Execution speed. That's why we're raising now—to hire a world-class team and move fast."

4. **"Why $12M valuation?"**
   - Answer: "2 peer-reviewed papers, 94.7% success rate, 3 enterprise PoCs, $500K ARR potential. Comparable to Seed rounds for deep-tech AI companies."

5. **"What if SWE-bench rank doesn't improve?"**
   - Answer: "We'll emphasize reliability over ranking. But we're hiring a dedicated ML team to ensure Top 10%."
