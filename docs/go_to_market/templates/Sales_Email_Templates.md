## Outbound Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: "Similar Company Success" (VP Engineering)

**Subject**: How [Similar Company] reduced code review time by 70%

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] recently [Trigger Event - e.g., "expanded your engineering team by 30%" or "announced a new product launch"].

We work with similar companies like [Customer 1] and [Customer 2] to automate their development workflows. Specifically:

• Issue → PR in 15 minutes (vs. 2-3 days manual)
• 70% reduction in code review time
• 3x increase in developer throughput

[Customer Name], VP Eng at [Customer Company], told us:
"Miyabi gave me back my weekends. My team ships 3x more features with the same headcount."

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this applies to [Company]?

### Template 2: "Quick Question" (Follow-Up #2)

**Subject**: Quick question about [Company]'s GitHub automation

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from [Day].

Quick question: How is [Company] currently handling code reviews and PR automation?

Most engineering teams we talk to struggle with:
1. 3-5 day PR review cycles (bottleneck)
2. 30-40% of developer time on toil (manual PRs, testing)
3. Inconsistent code quality across teams

If any of these resonate, let's chat for 15 minutes.

I'll show you how [Similar Company] went from 3-day PR cycles → 1 day with Miyabi.

**Subject**: Last attempt - worth 15 minutes?

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I don't want to keep bothering you, so this is my last email.

I genuinely believe Miyabi could save [Company] $[X] per year in developer productivity (based on your team size of [Y] developers).

Here's what we do:
• Automate Issue → PR → Deploy (no human intervention)
• Reduce code review time by 70%
• Increase developer throughput 3x

If this doesn't resonate, no worries - I'll stop emailing.

But if you're curious, let's chat for 15 minutes. Worst case, you learn something new.

## Objection Handling Templates

### Template 8: "Too Expensive" Objection

**Email After Call**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for the honest feedback on pricing. I understand $299/seat/month feels expensive.

Let's look at the ROI:
• **Your cost**: $299/seat/month × 100 devs = $29,900/month
• **Your savings**: 15 hours/week/dev × 100 devs × $100/hour = $150,000/week
• **Payback period**: Less than 1 week

Put another way: Miyabi pays for itself 5x over every month.

Also, we offer:
• **Pilot pricing**: 50% off first 50 seats (Year 1 only)
• **Annual prepay discount**: 10% off
• **Volume discount**: 20% off for 500+ seats

With pilot pricing, your cost drops to $14,950/month (saving you $135K/month net).

Worth revisiting?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Happy to send you our ROI calculator with your actual numbers. Just need:
• Number of developers
• Average developer hourly cost
• Current time spent on toil (we can estimate)
```

### Template 9: "Security Concerns" Objection

**Email After Call**:
```

Here's how we address it:

**1. Security Scanning**:
• CodeQL (GitHub Advanced Security) runs on every PR
• Gitleaks secret scanning
• SBOM generation (CycloneDX format)

**2. Code Quality**:
• 80%+ test coverage requirement (enforced)
• Human review required (Miyabi creates PR, you approve)
• ReviewAgent checks for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

**3. Compliance**:
• SOC 2 Type II certified (audit report attached)
• Annual penetration testing (results attached)
• GDPR/CCPA compliant

**4. Data Privacy**:
• Your code never leaves your VPC (on-premise option available)

### Template 12: "Upsell Opportunity"

**Subject**: Expanding Miyabi to [New Team]?

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [New Team] (e.g., "Platform Team") is still doing code reviews manually.

Your [Original Team] (e.g., "API Team") has seen amazing results with Miyabi:
• 70% faster code reviews
• 3x more features shipped
• 90 NPS

Would it make sense to expand Miyabi to [New Team]?

I can run a quick pilot (10 developers, 2 weeks) to show the value. No additional cost during the trial.

If it works (which I'm confident it will), we can add 20 more seats to your plan.

Interested?

Best,
[CSM Name]

P.S. I'll send you a case study from [Customer] who expanded from 20 → 200 seats in 6 months.
```

## Renewal & Expansion Templates

### Template 13: "90-Day Pre-Renewal Reminder"

**Subject**: Your Miyabi renewal is coming up in 90 days

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Your Miyabi contract renews on [Date] (90 days from now).

I wanted to reach out early to:
1. Make sure you're happy with Miyabi

**Your Results So Far**:
• 50,000 issues processed

3. **Upgrade**: Enterprise+ tier (custom agents, on-premise, dedicated support)

Let's schedule a QBR (Quarterly Business Review) to discuss:

[CSM Name]
```

### Template 14: "Churn Risk - Win-Back"

**Subject**: Can we make this right?

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] hasn't been using Miyabi much lately (only 10 issues processed in the last 2 weeks).

Is everything okay? Did something change?

I want to make sure we're delivering value. If we're not, let's fix it.

Common reasons customers reduce usage:
• Integration issues (we can help troubleshoot)
• Training gaps (we offer free workshops)
• Team changes (new developers need onboarding)
• Budget constraints (we can discuss pricing)

Can we hop on a 15-minute call to discuss?

I'm committed to making Miyabi work for [Company]. If we can't, I'll personally help you transition to another solution.

Best,
[CSM Name]

P.S. Your contract renews in [X] days. Let's chat before then.
```

## Best Practices

### Email Writing Tips

**Subject Lines**:
✅ DO: Personalize with company name, numbers, results

❌ DON'T: Use all caps, excessive punctuation
❌ DON'T: Use generic subjects ("Following up")

**Body**:
✅ DO: Keep under 150 words (short, scannable)
