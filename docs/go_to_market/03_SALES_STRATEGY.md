## Sales Methodology: MEDDPICC

### Why MEDDPICC?

**MEDDPICC** is the gold standard for enterprise SaaS sales (used by PTC, Salesforce, SAP). It ensures consistent qualification and reduces deal slippage.

### Framework Breakdown

#### **M - Metrics**
"What specific, quantifiable metrics will improve with Miyabi?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "What's your current average PR review time?"
- "What percentage of developer time is spent on toil?"
- "How many issues does your team close per sprint?"

**Documentation** (in CRM):
- Baseline metrics: 3-day PR review time, 40% time on toil
- Target metrics: 1.5-day PR review time, 10% time on toil
- Success criteria: 50% reduction in code review time

---

#### **E - Economic Buyer**
"Who has the budget authority to sign this deal?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "Who controls the budget for dev tools?"
- "What's the approval process for a purchase like this?"
- "Have you purchased similar tools before? Who signed?"

**Common Economic Buyers**:
- CTO / VP of Engineering (<$500K deals)
- CFO ($500K-$1M deals)
- CEO / Board (>$1M deals)

**Red Flag**: If AE hasn't spoken to Economic Buyer by PoC stage, deal is at risk.

---

#### **D - Decision Criteria**
"How will you evaluate vendors? What are your must-haves?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "What criteria are you using to evaluate solutions?"
- "If you had to rank the top 3 priorities, what would they be?"
- "What would cause you to say 'no' to Miyabi?"

**Common Decision Criteria**:
1. ROI: 50% cost reduction, 6-month payback
2. Security: SOC 2 Type II, penetration testing
3. Integration: GitHub Enterprise, Slack, Jira
4. Support: 99.9% SLA, 4-hour response time

**Action**: Create "Decision Criteria Scorecard" showing Miyabi wins 8/10 criteria vs. competitors.

---

#### **D - Decision Process**
"What are the steps from now until signed contract?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "Walk me through your buying process for a tool like this"
- "Who needs to sign off? (Legal, Procurement, CISO, CFO)"
- "What's the timeline for each step?"

**Common Process**:
1. Technical evaluation (2 weeks)
2. PoC (60 days)
3. Executive approval (2 weeks)
4. Legal review (2 weeks)
5. Procurement negotiation (2 weeks)
6. CFO sign-off (1 week)
**Total**: ~90 days from PoC start to signed deal

**Action**: Create "Decision Process Map" in CRM, track each step.

---

#### **P - Paper Process**
"What's the contract approval process? What legal terms are non-negotiable?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "Do you have a standard MSA (Master Service Agreement)?"
- "Are there any contract terms that are deal-breakers?"
- "How long does legal review typically take?"

**Common Paper Issues**:
- **Liability cap**: Customer wants unlimited, we cap at 12 months fees
- **Data residency**: Customer requires on-premise, we offer VPC deployment
- **SLA penalties**: Customer wants 99.99%, we offer 99.9%
- **Payment terms**: Customer wants Net 60, we require Net 30

**Action**: Send Miyabi standard MSA early (Week 1 of PoC) to surface issues.

---

#### **I - Identify Pain**
"What happens if you don't solve this problem? What's the cost of inaction?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "If you don't solve [pain], what happens in 6 months?"
- "How much is this costing you today? (developer hours, missed deadlines)"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how critical is this problem?"

**Pain Quantification**:
- **Current state**: 100 developers × 15 hours/week toil × $100/hour = $150K/week = $7.8M/year wasted
- **Cost of inaction**: Competitors ship faster, lose market share, developer attrition
- **Urgency**: "We need to ship our next release 3 months earlier or we lose to [Competitor]"

**Red Flag**: If pain score <7/10, deal will likely stall. Disqualify or re-engage when pain increases.

---

#### **C - Champion**
"Who is our internal advocate? Will they sell on our behalf?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "If we weren't on this call, who would you discuss Miyabi with?"
- "Who do you trust to evaluate technical solutions like this?"
- "Would you be willing to advocate for Miyabi to [Economic Buyer]?"

**Champion Characteristics**:
- ✅ Has authority or influence with Economic Buyer
- ✅ Personally benefits from Miyabi (makes their job easier)
- ✅ Willing to share internal info (timeline, objections, budget)
- ✅ Will sell on our behalf in internal meetings

**Champion Development**:
- Week 1: Build rapport, understand personal goals
- Week 2: Provide ammo (ROI calc, case studies, talking points)
- Week 3: Prep for internal pitch, role-play objections
- Week 4: Debrief after internal meeting, adjust strategy

**Red Flag**: If no champion by technical deep-dive stage, deal is at risk.

---

#### **C - Competition**
"Who else are you evaluating? What do they do better than us?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "Are you looking at other solutions?"
- "What do you like about [Competitor]?"
- "If we weren't in the picture, who would you choose?"

**Competitive Landscape**:
- **GitHub Copilot**: Positioning - "Copilot is great for line completion, Miyabi handles full workflow automation"
- **Cursor AI**: Positioning - "Cursor requires a human driver, Miyabi is fully autonomous"
- **Devin AI**: Positioning - "Devin is limited availability, Miyabi is production-ready today"
- **Build In-House**: Positioning - "That's a 2-year project with 5 engineers. Why not buy Miyabi and ship features instead?"

**Competitive Battle Card**: See [Competitive_Battle_Cards.md](./templates/Competitive_Battle_Cards.md)
