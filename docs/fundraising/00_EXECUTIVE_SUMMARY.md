## 💡 Key Insights for Success

### Do's ✅
1. **Lead with papers** - Academic credibility is your superpower
2. **Emphasize Sakana AI** - Investors love pattern matching ($244M validation)
3. **Show math** - Proofs differentiate you from every competitor
4. **Focus on unit economics** - Your numbers are world-class, highlight them
5. **Be transparent** - Honest about challenges, show mitigation plans
6. **Create FOMO** - Weekly updates, momentum, multiple VCs in parallel
7. **Over-prepare** - Know every number, every customer, every competitor

### Don'ts ❌
1. **Don't oversell** - Let the data speak, avoid hype
2. **Don't ignore red flags** - Address concerns directly
3. **Don't take first term sheet** - Get 2-3 to create competition
4. **Don't rush diligence** - Thorough > fast (2-4 weeks is normal)
5. **Don't forget references** - Prep customers to take VC calls
6. **Don't stop operating** - Keep shipping, growing, hiring during fundraise
7. **Don't neglect existing investors** - Keep them updated, they can help

### CFO-Level Tactics
1. **Valuation Psychology**: Anchor high ($15M post for seed), negotiate down to target ($12M)
2. **Option Pool**: Argue for post-money pool (less dilution) or small pool (10% not 15%)
3. **Liquidation Prefs**: Accept 1× non-participating only. Reject participating or >1×
4. **Board Composition**: Maintain founder control. Max 1 investor seat (seed), 2 seats (Series A)
5. **Pro Rata Rights**: Give to lead only initially, not all investors (avoid future caps)
6. **Information Rights**: Standard monthly financials OK, but limit frequency (not weekly)
7. **Drag-Along Rights**: Accept for >50% vote, not simple majority
8. **Anti-Dilution**: Accept broad-based weighted average, reject full ratchet
