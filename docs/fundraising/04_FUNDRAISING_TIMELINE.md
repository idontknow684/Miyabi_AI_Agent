## Critical Path & Dependencies

### Fundraising Critical Path

```
arXiv Papers → AAAI Acceptance → PoC Customers → Seed Close
     ↓              ↓                  ↓              ↓
  (Month 1)    (Month 3)          (Month 4)      (Month 6)

Seed Close → Hiring → Product Launch → First Revenue
     ↓          ↓           ↓              ↓
  (Month 6)  (Month 7)  (Month 8)      (Month 9)

First Revenue → Scale → $1M ARR → Series A Prep
      ↓          ↓         ↓            ↓
   (Month 9)  (Months    (Month 12)  (Month 13)
               10-11)

Series A Prep → Meetings → Term Sheet → Close
      ↓            ↓           ↓          ↓
   (Month 13)  (Months     (Month 17) (Month 18)
                14-16)
```

### Key Dependencies

**Seed Fundraising (Months 1-6)**:
- **MUST HAVE**: arXiv papers published, GitHub traction
- **SHOULD HAVE**: AAAI acceptance, 3-5 PoC customers
- **NICE TO HAVE**: Early revenue, strong community (Discord, Twitter)

**Series A Fundraising (Months 13-18)**:
- **MUST HAVE**: $1M+ ARR, 10+ paying customers, repeatable sales
- **SHOULD HAVE**: $3M ARR, 30+ customers, 120% NDR
- **NICE TO HAVE**: US customers, top-tier logos, SWE-bench top 10%

### Risk Mitigation

**If Papers Don't Get AAAI Acceptance** (Month 3):
- **Backup Plan**: Submit to ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI next year
- **Impact**: Minor - arXiv traction matters more to investors
- **Mitigation**: Focus on GitHub stars, PoC customers

**If Seed Takes Longer (Month 6 → Month 9)**:
- **Backup Plan**: Extend runway via:
  - Consulting revenue (use Miyabi for client projects)
  - Angels/pre-seed ($500K-1M to bridge)
  - Slow down hiring (hire 2 engineers, not 4)
- **Impact**: Delays Series A by 3 months
- **Mitigation**: Keep burn low ($100K/mo instead of $190K)

**If Series A Takes Longer (Month 18 → Month 24)**:
- **Backup Plan**: Raise extension round ($5M at same valuation)
- **Impact**: Dilution, but not fatal
- **Mitigation**: Focus on profitability - cut to $1M/mo burn
