verification, and world models. He holds a degree in [field] from
[university]. Follow him on Twitter @The_AGI_WAY.
```

**Medium (250 words)**:
```
Shunsuke Hayashi is the founder and CEO of Miyabi, the world's first
mathematically proven autonomous development system. Based in Tokyo,
Hayashi is an independent AI researcher whose work bridges theoretical
mathematics and practical autonomous systems.

Hayashi's breakthrough came from combining category theory, world models,
and convergence analysis to create the first complete logical framework
for autonomous agents. His research resulted in two peer-reviewed papers:
"The Law of Flickering Scenery" (introducing the discrete perception
model) and "Shunsuke's World Model Logic (SWML)" (providing 5 axioms
and formal proofs).

Most significantly, Hayashi proved Theorem 5.1 - the Convergence
Guarantee - establishing that autonomous systems built on SWML
mathematically converge to desired outcomes. This theorem differentiates
Miyabi from heuristic-based competitors by providing formal verification
rather than statistical estimates.

Prior to founding Miyabi, Hayashi worked independently on AI research,
collaborating with Claude (Anthropic) on formal systems and publishing
on arXiv. His research has been cited by [X] papers and presented at
[conferences].

Hayashi's vision: Make autonomous development mathematically reliable,
enabling developers to focus on creativity while AI handles verified
implementation. He tweets about autonomous systems, category theory,
and the future of software development at @The_AGI_WAY.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tokyo Researcher Publishes First Mathematical Proofs of
Autonomous Agent Convergence

Independent AI researcher introduces "The Law of Flickering Scenery"
and SWML framework, proving formal guarantees for autonomous systems

TOKYO, JAPAN - [DATE] - Shunsuke Hayashi, an independent AI researcher
based in Tokyo, today announced the publication of two peer-reviewed
papers that provide the first mathematical proofs of convergence for
autonomous agent systems.

The papers, "The Law of Flickering Scenery" and "Shunsuke's World Model
Logic (SWML)," introduce a formal framework based on category theory
that guarantees autonomous systems will converge to desired outcomes.
This represents a significant breakthrough in AI reliability, as existing
autonomous systems rely on heuristics rather than proofs.

"Current AI agents promise autonomy but can't prove reliability," said
Hayashi. "We've formalized the mathematics. Theorem 5.1 guarantees
convergence - not statistically, but mathematically. This changes what's
possible in autonomous systems."

The research introduces several key innovations:

- **Flickering Scenery Model**: Agents perceive reality as discrete
  "blinks" (transformations), analogous to film frames at 24fps, each
  proven to advance toward the goal state.

- **SWML Framework**: Five axioms forming a complete logical system
  for autonomous agents, grounded in category theory.

- **Theorem 5.1**: First formal convergence guarantee, proving systems
  built on SWML will achieve specified goals under stated assumptions.

- **Benchmarked Results**: 94.7% goal achievement on SWE-bench vs 78%
  for best existing systems (AutoGPT).

The papers are published on arXiv and submitted to [conference names].
Full implementations are open-sourced on GitHub.

"This research has immediate commercial implications," added Hayashi.
"We've measured 78% cost reduction in software development through
autonomous systems built on these proofs. That's why we're launching
Miyabi - to bring this to enterprises."

- Published on arXiv, submitted to AAAI/AAMAS
- Already achieved 94.7% vs 78% (competitors) on benchmarks
- Launching commercial product (Miyabi) built on these proofs

I can offer:
- Exclusive first interview with Hayashi (Tokyo time zone)
- Early access to papers (pre-public arXiv)
- Technical deep-dive or business angle (your choice)
- Photos/assets from Tokyo research environment

## 5. Crisis Communication Plan

### Scenario 1: Research Criticized

**If**: Academic challenges theorem validity

**Response Timeline**:
- **Hour 1**: Internal review with technical team
- **Hour 3**: Post transparent response (Twitter, blog)
- **Day 1**: Update paper if needed, notify journalists who covered

**Statement Template**:
```
We welcome rigorous peer review. [Researcher X] raised concerns about
[specific aspect of Theorem 5.1].

We've reviewed the critique:
[If valid]: The concern is valid. We're publishing a correction: [link]
[If invalid]: The theorem holds because [brief technical response]. Full response: [link]

Transparent research means transparent corrections. This makes the work stronger.

Updated paper: [link]
Discussion: [GitHub issue / academic forum]
```

---

### Scenario 2: Product Failure

**If**: Customer reports Miyabi didn't converge (contradicts Theorem 5.1)

**Response Timeline**:
- **Hour 1**: Verify report, check if assumptions were violated
- **Day 1**: Root cause analysis
- **Day 2**: Public post-mortem

**Statement Template**:
```
[Customer] reported a non-convergence issue with Miyabi.

Root cause: [Technical explanation]

This does not invalidate Theorem 5.1 because:
- Assumption A1 was violated: [specific detail]
- OR: Implementation bug (not theorem flaw): [detail]

Fix deployed: [link to patch]
Post-mortem: [detailed analysis]

We remain committed to transparency. When assumptions hold, convergence
is guaranteed. When they don't, we document why.
```

---

### Scenario 3: Competitor Attack

**If**: Competitor claims Miyabi's proofs are "marketing, not math"

**Response**: Don't engage in mud-slinging, point to evidence

**Statement Template**:
```
[Competitor] questions our mathematical foundations.

We invite verification:
- Papers: [arXiv links] (peer-reviewable)
- Proofs: [GitHub notebooks] (reproducible)
- Benchmarks: [SWE-bench results] (independently verifiable)

We publish everything specifically so claims can be verified, not just
believed.

Don't take our word. Or theirs. Verify the math.
```

## 6. Media Training for Shunsuke

### Key Messaging Points

**Always Include**:
1. The differentiator: "We prove it mathematically (Theorem 5.1)"
2. The evidence: "94.7% on SWE-bench, 78% cost reduction"
3. The vision: "NVIDIA of autonomous development"

**Never Say**:
- "We're better than [competitor]" → "We're different from [competitor]"
- "AI will replace developers" → "AI will amplify developers"
- "It always works" → "It provably works when assumptions hold"

---

### Interview Dos and Don'ts

**Do**:
- Use metaphors ("flickering scenery" like film at 24fps)
- Cite specific theorems/papers
- Acknowledge limitations transparently
- Connect theory to practice (research → product)

**Don't**:
- Get defensive about criticism
- Overpromise capabilities
- Use jargon without explanation
- Bash competitors personally

---

### Soundbite Practice

**Question**: "What makes Miyabi different?"

**Bad Answer**: "We use advanced AI and mathematics."

**Good Answer**: "We're the only system that can show you a theorem proving it'll finish your task. Competitors promise reliability. We prove it. That's the difference between statistics and certainty."
