              Every developer has a
           mathematically proven AI partner
                        |
                   POSITIONING
              "Proven. Not Promised."
         First Autonomous Development System
            with mathematical guarantees
                        |
                    VALUES
      Mathematical Rigor | Poetic Simplicity
         Transparency | Developer-First
           Ambition Grounded in Reality

```

---

### Brand Differentiation Framework

**What competitors say**: "Our AI helps you code faster"
**What Miyabi says**: "We prove your task will converge. Mathematically."

**The Difference**:
- **Competitors**: Heuristics, patterns, statistics ("probably works")
- **Miyabi**: Theorems, proofs, guarantees ("provably works")

**The Moat**:
- Peer-reviewed research (2 papers)
- Formal proofs (Theorem 5.1)
- Open-source verification
- Academic credibility

**The Result**:
- Competitors can copy features → We can copy features
- Competitors cannot copy theorems → We have research moat
- Trust built on mathematics, not marketing
