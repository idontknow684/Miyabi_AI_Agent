## Key Themes Across All Documents

### 1. Mathematical Certainty as Differentiator
Every document reinforces: **We prove, competitors promise.**
- Theorem 5.1: Convergence Guarantee
- Peer-reviewed research (2 papers)
- Reproducible benchmarks (SWE-bench: 94.7% vs 78%)

### 2. Research-First Credibility
Following Sakana AI playbook:
- Papers → arXiv → Conferences → Media → Customers → Funding
- "Prove theorems first, pitch investors second"
- Academic rigor = moat (can't be copied without equivalent research)

### 3. Category Creation: "Autonomous Development Systems"
We're not competing in "AI coding tools" - we're creating a new category:
- ADS = Complete autonomy + Formal verification + Convergence guarantees
- Miyabi is the first (and only) true ADS
- Category ownership = market leadership

### 4. Transparency as Trust
Radical openness:
- Full papers published (arXiv)
- Open-source implementation (GitHub)
- Reproducible benchmarks
- "Don't trust us. Verify us."

### 5. Developer Amplification, Not Replacement
Consistent messaging:
- 78% of tasks are repetitive → automate these
- 22% is creative problem-solving → humans excel here
- AI handles verified patterns, developers handle innovation
