# Community Brand Guidelines

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-07
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Owner**: Chief Brand Officer

---

## Executive Summary

The Miyabi community is built on **mathematical rigor, open collaboration, and respectful discourse**. These guidelines ensure our community embodies our brand values while welcoming developers, researchers, and enterprises who want to verify, contribute, and build on Autonomous Development Systems.

**Core Principle**: "We prove, we share, we improve - together."

---

## 1. Community Values

### Value 1: Verification Over Trust
**What it means**: Every claim must be verifiable. We don't ask members to trust - we provide proofs, code, and data.

**In practice**:
- All technical claims link to proofs or benchmarks
- Community members can (and should) challenge claims with evidence
- "Don't trust, verify" is celebrated, not discouraged

**Community Behavior**:
✅ "I verified Theorem 5.1 in Coq, here's my proof script"
✅ "Reproduced SWE-bench results, got 94.2% (within margin of error)"
✅ "Question: How does SWML handle [edge case]? Here's my analysis"
❌ "Just trust that it works"
❌ "Miyabi is the best because I say so"

---

### Value 2: Rigor With Kindness
**What it means**: High standards for technical accuracy, high empathy for people learning.

**In practice**:
- Critique ideas rigorously, never people
- Beginners get patient explanations (no "RTFM")
- Mathematical precision + human warmth

**Community Behavior**:
✅ "Your proof has a gap in Step 3. Here's why: [explanation]"
✅ "Great question! Let me break down Theorem 5.1 in simpler terms..."
✅ "I disagree with this approach because [technical reason], but I appreciate you thinking about this"
❌ "This is stupid, did you even read the paper?"
❌ "RTFM noob"
❌ "Obviously you don't understand category theory"

---

### Value 3: Open Collaboration
**What it means**: Research and implementation are open-source. Contributions are celebrated.

**In practice**:
- GitHub is the source of truth
- All papers publicly available (arXiv)
- Community contributions credited prominently
- Forks and alternatives encouraged (if rigorous)

**Community Behavior**:
✅ "I implemented SWML in Python, here's the repo"
✅ "Found a bug in the executor, PR submitted"
✅ "Extended Theorem 5.1 to cover [new case], draft paper: [link]"
❌ "This is proprietary, I won't share"
❌ Taking credit for others' work
❌ Gatekeeping ("only we can work on this")

---

### Value 4: Substance Over Hype
**What it means**: We value quiet excellence over loud mediocrity. Results speak louder than marketing.

**In practice**:
- Data > Anecdotes
- Proofs > Claims
- Working code > Vaporware demos

**Community Behavior**:
✅ "Here are my benchmark results: [data, methodology, repo]"
✅ "I proved this property holds under assumptions X, Y, Z: [proof]"
✅ "Deployed in production, here's what I learned: [lessons]"
❌ "This will revolutionize everything!" (without evidence)
❌ "Coming soon" announcements without code
❌ Hype-driven claims without reproducibility

---

### Value 5: Diversity of Thought, Unity of Purpose
**What it means**: Multiple approaches to autonomous systems are welcome. Shared commitment to mathematical rigor.

**In practice**:
- Different implementations (Rust, Python, Haskell) encouraged
- Alternative theorems/proofs welcomed (if rigorous)
- Respectful debate on approaches
- Zero tolerance for discrimination

**Community Behavior**:
✅ "I disagree with using category theory, here's an alternative: [paper]"
✅ "Implemented SWML in Haskell for different type guarantees"
✅ "Compared Miyabi vs [other approach], here's data: [link]"
❌ Dismissing entire fields/approaches without technical justification
❌ Discrimination based on identity, background, affiliation
❌ "My way or the highway" attitudes

---

## 2. Code of Conduct

## 11. Brand Consistency in Community

### What Community Members Can Say

**✅ Approved Messaging**:
- "Miyabi is mathematically proven" (cite Theorem 5.1)
- "First autonomous system with convergence guarantees"
- "Built on peer-reviewed research"
- "Open-source and verifiable"

**❌ Unapproved Claims**:
- "Miyabi is the best AI tool" (subjective, no proof)
- "Miyabi will replace all developers" (false, not our position)
- "Miyabi is perfect / has no limitations" (dishonest)
- Made-up statistics or benchmarks

**When Unsure**: Link to official resources instead of paraphrasing

---

### Visual Consistency

**Community Content**:
- Use official logo (from brand assets)
- Follow color palette (if designing graphics)
- Credit "Miyabi" properly (not "miyabi", "MIYABI", "Myabi")

**Slide Decks** (when presenting Miyabi):
- Use official templates (if provided)
- Include proper citations to papers
- Add "miyabi.dev" on each slide
