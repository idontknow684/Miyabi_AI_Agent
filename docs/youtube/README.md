3. **Open Source**: Viewers can actually try it
4. **Yukkuri Format**: Japanese market specialty

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

| **Negative comments** | Prepare FAQ, respond proactively |

### Contingency Plans

## FAQ

### Q: Can I do this with $0 budget?

**A**: Yes! All essential tools are free (YMM4, VOICEVOX, Canva Free, free stock images). You'll invest time instead of money (~192 hours). Expected outcome: 10K-50K views.

### Q: How much time does this take?

**A**:
- **DIY (minimal budget)**: ~192 hours (24 working days)
- **Hybrid (selective outsourcing)**: ~140 hours (17.5 days)
- **Team (premium budget)**: ~40 hours (5 days of your time)

### Q: What if I don't speak Japanese?

**A**: The Yukkuri format is specifically for the Japanese market. For English, you'd modify:
- Skip Yukkuri characters
- Use different narration style
- Adjust cultural references
- Optimize for English-speaking platforms (different keywords, communities)

### Q: When should I start?

**A**: Ideal timing considerations:
1. **Paper published**: Launch video within 1-2 weeks of arXiv publication
2. **GitHub ready**: Ensure repository is polished (README, examples)
3. **Trend alignment**: Check if AI agent topic is trending
4. **Your availability**: Need 4-5 weeks of focused work

### Q: What about monetization?

**A**: This workflow focuses on **business impact** (fundraising) rather than ad revenue. However:
- If you join YouTube Partner Program: ~$2-5 per 1K views
- 100K views = $200-500 ad revenue
- But 1,000 GitHub stars → Easier fundraising → $100K-1M potential

**Priority**: GitHub stars > Ad revenue

### Q: Can I hire someone to do this?

**A**: Yes. Budget tiers:
- **Freelancers (Fiverr)**: $500-1,000 total
  - Thumbnail: $50-100
  - Script editing: $50-100
  - Video editing: $200-400
  - Promotion help: $200-400
- **Professional team**: $3,000-10,000
  - Full service production
  - Fast turnaround (2 weeks)
  - High quality guaranteed

But consider: DIY = better understanding for future videos + authentic voice
