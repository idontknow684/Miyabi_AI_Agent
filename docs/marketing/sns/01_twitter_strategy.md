2. Context: Existing approaches (ReAct, AutoGPT) lack theory
3. Our solution: Flickering Scenery paradigm
4. Visual: Blink sequence diagram
5. Math: The unified formula

• [Academic blog]

The Law of Flickering Scenery is resonating with the AI community.

Why? Because we're solving a REAL problem: unpredictable agent behavior.

More coverage: [link]
```

**Day 3 (Wednesday): Technical Deep Dive**
```
🧠 Deep dive: What is a "blink"?

In traditional systems, agents process everything at once.

In Flickering Scenery, agents perceive the world in discrete snapshots.

Like frames in a movie at 24fps.

Each blink transforms the world: World_n → World_{n+1}

Here's why this matters 🧵
```

**Day 4 (Thursday): Comparison Thread**
```
How does Flickering Scenery compare to:
• ReAct
• AutoGPT
• BabyAGI
• Chain-of-Thought

Spoiler: We're the ONLY system with formal convergence guarantees.

Detailed comparison 🧵👇
```

**Day 5 (Friday): Community Engagement**
```
Question for the AI community:

What's the BIGGEST challenge you face with autonomous agents today?

1. Unpredictable behavior
2. Slow execution
3. Poor goal understanding
4. Lack of transparency

**Day 7 (Sunday): Week Summary**
```
Week 1 recap:

📄 Paper published on arXiv
⭐ 100+ GitHub stars

### Week 2: SWML Paper Launch

**Day 8 (Monday): SWML Announcement**
```
🔬 NEW PAPER ALERT 🔬

"Shunsuke's World Model Logic (SWML)"

The complete mathematical foundation for autonomous agents.

5 axioms. Category theory. Fully implemented in Rust.

This is the theory behind Flickering Scenery.

arXiv: [link]
GitHub: [link]

Thread 🧵👇
```

**Thread Structure (15 tweets):**
1. Hook: We proved it works
2. The 5 axioms (brief intro)
3. Axiom 1: World Representation (ℐ × 𝒲 → ℛ)
4. Axiom 2: Transformation Operators
5. Axiom 3: Convergence
6. Axiom 4: Resource Management
7. Axiom 5: Observability
8. Category theory connection
9. Implementation mapping (Math → Rust)
10. Experimental validation (92 GitHub Issues)
11. SWE-bench results
12. Why this matters (reliability, predictability)
13. Comparison to other frameworks
14. Future applications
15. Call to action

**Day 9 (Tuesday): Math Explained Simply**
```
"SWML uses category theory."

If you just thought "ugh, math"—I get it.

But here's why it's POWERFUL:

Category theory lets us compose operations like LEGO blocks.

No math PhD required. Let me show you 🧵👇
```

**Day 10 (Wednesday): Implementation Thread**
```
From math to code: How we implemented SWML in Rust

Rust's type system maps perfectly to category theory.

Here's the magic:

Math: Ω: ℐ × 𝒲 → ℛ
Rust: fn omega(intent: Intent, world: World) -> Result

Thread with code snippets 🧵👇
```

**Day 11 (Thursday): Benchmark Results**
```
📊 SWML Performance Results

We tested on 92 real GitHub Issues from production repos.

Results:
• 89% success rate
• Avg convergence: 8.3 iterations
• 2.78× faster than sequential

Compared to:
• AutoGPT: 78% success
• ReAct: 73% success
• Sequential: 1× (baseline)

Detailed analysis 🧵👇
```

**Day 12 (Friday): Ask Me Anything**
```
It's been 2 weeks since we dropped Flickering Scenery + SWML.

The response has been incredible.

Let's do an AMA!

Ask me ANYTHING about:
• The research
• Implementation
• Autonomous agents
• Fundraising plans

I'll answer every question 👇
```

3. Execution: 8 blinks
4. Result: Clean docs/, src/, examples/

Time: 12.3 seconds
Success: ✅

More examples 🧵👇
```

**Day 18 (Thursday): Comparison Video**
```
📹 NEW VIDEO: Flickering vs AutoGPT

Same task. Different approaches.

Flickering:
• 8 iterations
• Predictable convergence
• 12 seconds

AutoGPT:
• 15+ iterations
• Partial completion
• 45 seconds

Watch: [YouTube link]

Why the difference? 🧵👇
```

**Day 19 (Friday): Developer Testimonial**
```
"I tried Miyabi on a legacy codebase refactor.

It completed in 2 hours what would've taken me 2 days.

The best part? I could see EXACTLY what it was doing at each step."

— [Beta user], Senior Engineer @ [Company]

Try it yourself: [GitHub link]
```

**Days 20-21 (Weekend): Founder Story**
```
Why I built Miyabi:

Thread 🧵👇

1/ I was frustrated by unreliable AI agents.

Sometimes they'd work perfectly. Other times, completely fail.

No one could explain WHY.

2/ I realized: we need mathematical foundations.

Not just prompts. Not just heuristics.

Actual proofs.
