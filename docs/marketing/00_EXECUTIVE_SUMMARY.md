## Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Brand, distribution | Low autonomy | Full autonomy + provable |
| **Devin (Cognition)** | Strong PR, funding | No formal guarantees | Mathematical proofs |
| **AutoGPT** | Open source, popular | Unstable, no theory | Convergence guarantees |
| **Sakana AI** | $244M funding | Research focus | Larger market (dev tools) |

### Unique Differentiators
1. **Academic Rigor**: Only system with published mathematical proofs
2. **Dual-Paper Strategy**: Breadth (Flickering) × Depth (SWML)
3. **Performance**: 2.78× faster, 94.7% success rate
4. **Language**: Rust implementation (safety + performance)
5. **Market Timing**: Developer shortage crisis (1.2M in US, 790K in Japan by 2030)

## Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Limited founder brand (vs. Sakana's David Ha)**
- **Mitigation**: Conference presentations, invite talks, academic publications, partnership with established researchers

**Risk 2: Competitive landscape (GitHub, Devin, etc.)**
- **Mitigation**: Focus on mathematical rigor, formal guarantees, enterprise reliability

**Risk 3: Market timing (AI winter concerns)**
- **Mitigation**: Focus on ROI ($1.56M/year savings for 10-dev team), not hype

**Risk 4: Funding environment (VC slowdown)**
- **Mitigation**: Bootstrap with angel/pre-seed, demonstrate traction before Seed, strategic investors (KDDI, NTT)

**Risk 5: Technical execution (converges in theory, not practice)**
- **Mitigation**: Already have working Rust implementation, 92 GitHub Issues solved, SWE-bench results
