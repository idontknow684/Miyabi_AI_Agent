FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

# Miyabi Announces "The Law of Flickering Scenery," The First Mathematically Proven Framework for Autonomous AI Agents

*Tokyo-based researcher publishes breakthrough that guarantees agent reliability through formal convergence proofs*

**TOKYO, Japan – November 7, 2025** – Miyabi today announced the publication of "The Law of Flickering Scenery" on arXiv, introducing the first unified mathematical framework for intent-driven autonomous agent systems with formal convergence guarantees. Unlike existing AI agent systems (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, Devin) that rely on heuristic approaches, Miyabi's framework provides mathematical proofs that agents will reliably achieve specified goals.

## The Autonomous Agent Reliability Crisis

Current AI agent systems suffer from unpredictable behavior, with success rates averaging 60-78% in production environments. This unreliability has prevented widespread enterprise adoption despite significant investment ($1.5B in 2024 alone). The core issue: lack of formal foundations.

"We're asking AI systems to make critical decisions—refactoring codebases, managing infrastructure, handling customer data—but we have no mathematical guarantee they'll do it correctly," said Shunsuke Hayashi, founder of Miyabi. "It's like flying a plane without understanding aerodynamics. We needed the math."

## The Flickering Scenery Paradigm

The Law of Flickering Scenery introduces a novel discrete-continuous perception model where agents observe the world as a sequence of momentary snapshots ("blinks"), each transformed through a six-phase cycle:

1. **Understand**: Perceive world state
2. **Generate**: Create execution plan
3. **Allocate**: Assign tasks to resources
4. **Execute**: Perform transformations
5. **Integrate**: Merge results consistently
6. **Learn**: Extract patterns for improvement

The framework is formalized through the unified agent formula:

**𝔸(Input, World₀) = lim_{n→∞} [∫₀ⁿ (Θ ◦ 𝒞 ◦ ℐ)(t) dt] = World_∞**

Where ℐ represents intent resolution, 𝒞 represents command stack decomposition, and Θ represents world transformation.

## Proven Results

In experiments across 35 tasks spanning software development, document generation, and project management, Miyabi's implementation achieved:

- **94.7% goal achievement rate** (vs. 78.3% for AutoGPT)
- **2.78× performance improvement** through parallel execution
- **8.3 iterations average convergence** time (predictable and bounded)
- **Zero system corruption** failures (transactional guarantees)

"The difference between 78% and 95% success rate isn't incremental—it's the difference between unusable and production-ready," noted Hayashi. "Our formal proofs guarantee convergence. This isn't just engineering; it's mathematics."

## Open Source & Research Transparency

True to its research-first mission, Miyabi has open-sourced the complete Rust implementation on GitHub, allowing the global developer community to validate, extend, and build upon the framework.

"We're following the Sakana AI playbook," explained Hayashi. "Research credibility first, community second, commercialization third. Transparency builds trust, and trust accelerates adoption."

The framework has already attracted attention from enterprise development teams at major Japanese technology companies, with pilot programs underway at several Fortune 500 firms.

## About Miyabi

Miyabi is building the world's first mathematically proven autonomous development system. Founded in 2025 by independent researcher Shunsuke Hayashi, Miyabi combines formal methods from mathematics and computer science with modern AI capabilities to create reliable, predictable autonomous agents. The company is based in Tokyo, Japan.

"We didn't start with a product. We started with a problem that needed mathematical rigor," said Shunsuke Hayashi, Founder & CEO of Miyabi. "Current AI agents fail 20-40% of the time because they lack formal foundations. We published the math first, validated it with the community, and only then built a product. That's the Sakana AI playbook."

## Why Investors Are Excited

[LEAD INVESTOR NAME], Partner at [LEAD INVESTOR], commented: "The autonomous agent space is crowded with hype, but Miyabi stands out for one reason: they have proofs, not promises. The formal convergence guarantees mean enterprises can actually trust this system with production workloads. That's a $10B+ opportunity."

The funding round included strategic investment from [JAPANESE TELCO/BANK], providing Miyabi with access to [X] potential enterprise customers in Japan. "Japan is facing a severe developer shortage—790,000 unfilled positions by 2030," noted Hayashi. "Autonomous development isn't optional; it's existential."

## Developer Shortage Meets Proven Solution

The global software development market is facing a critical talent shortage:
- **1.2M unfilled positions** in the US by 2030
- **790K unfilled positions** in Japan by 2030

- **2.78× faster execution** through parallel orchestration
- **$1.56M/year savings** for a 10-developer team (per internal analysis)
- **6-12 month payback period**

"Our enterprise pilots are showing 180% productivity gains," said Hayashi. "Developers love it because they're freed from repetitive tasks to focus on architecture and innovation."

## Product Roadmap

The Seed funding will enable Miyabi to:
1. **Ship V1.0** (Q1 2026): Production-ready autonomous development platform
2. **Expand Team**: Hire 5-8 engineers (Rust, ML, DevOps)
3. **Enterprise Features**: SOC 2 compliance, SSO, on-prem deployment
4. **Geographic Expansion**: US market entry (Q2 2026)
5. **Research Continuation**: Additional papers, conference presentations

"This is a marathon, not a sprint," emphasized Hayashi. "Sakana AI spent 1.5 years on research before monetizing. We're following the same patient approach—build trust, then build revenue."

## About Miyabi

Miyabi is building the world's first mathematically proven autonomous development system. Based on two published research papers (Flickering Scenery + SWML), Miyabi's framework provides formal convergence guarantees, enabling reliable autonomous software development at enterprise scale.

```

### Template C: The Verge (Innovation/Consumer Angle)

```
Subject: The "Flickering Scenery" Theory That Could Make AI Agents Actually Work

Hi [Name],

Quick pitch: There's a new way to think about AI agents that's both poetic and mathematically rigorous.

It's called "The Law of Flickering Scenery."

**The concept:**
Instead of perceiving the world continuously (overwhelming), agents perceive it as discrete "blinks"—like frames in a film at 24fps. Each blink transforms the world one step closer to the goal.

**Why it's cool:**
- Beautiful metaphor (vs. dry academic papers)
- Solves real problem (agents currently fail ~30% of the time)
- Open source + research papers (transparency)
- Already working (94.7% success rate)

**The narrative:**
- Solo founder in Tokyo (not Silicon Valley)
- Published research first (not hype-driven)
- Community-driven (1K+ GitHub stars organically)
- Fighting AI unreliability with math

**Visual potential:**
- Animated diagrams of "blinks"
- Interactive demo (try it yourself)
- Comparison videos (Miyabi vs. AutoGPT on same task)

Think this could work for The Verge?

Best,
Shunsuke
miyabi.dev
```

### Template D: Wired (Deep Tech/Research Angle)

```
Subject: Formal Methods Meet AI: The Return of Mathematical Rigor to Agent Systems

Hi [Name],

WIRED has covered the gap between AI hype and AI reality. I have a story that bridges that gap with mathematics.

**The thesis:**
Current AI agents (AutoGPT, Devin, BabyAGI) are built on prompts and heuristics. They fail unpredictably because they lack formal foundations. Miyabi has published the first agent framework with mathematical convergence proofs—borrowing techniques from control theory, category theory, and formal methods.

**Why this matters beyond tech:**
- Echoes 1960s debate: Formal methods vs. hacking
- NASA uses formal methods for spacecraft (zero tolerance for failure)
- Now AI needs the same rigor for autonomous systems
- This is "AI safety" through mathematics, not alignment hand-waving

**The human story:**
- Independent researcher (no corporate backing initially)
- 6 months of pure research before any product
- Community-validated (open source, peer review)
- Contrarian bet: Slow down, build foundations

**The results:**
- 94.7% success rate (vs. 78% for baselines)
- Proven convergence (will definitely finish, not loop forever)
- Already attracting enterprise interest

This feels like a WIRED deep-dive: Mathematics → Philosophy → Practice.

Interested?
