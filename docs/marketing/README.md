## FAQs

### Q: Do I really need to spend 7 hours/day on marketing?
**A:** In the first 3 months, yes. After that, delegate.

Sakana AI's David Ha was extremely active on Twitter during their launch. That network became their customers.

### Q: What if I'm not a good writer?
**A:** Use the templates. Hire a freelance editor on Upwork ($50/article) to polish your drafts.

### Q: Can I skip some channels?
**A:** Yes. Pick 2-3 core channels and execute them well. Better to own Twitter + Medium than to be mediocre at 10 channels.

### Q: What if I don't get press coverage?
**A:** Keep building community and traction. Press follows momentum. Get to 5,000 GitHub stars and journalists will find you.

### Q: Should I hire a PR agency?
**A:** Not until Series A. Bootstrap with direct outreach first. Agencies cost $5K-10K/month and have mixed results for early-stage startups.

### Q: What's the ONE most important thing?
**A:** **Consistency**. Post daily. Engage daily. Build daily. For 90 days straight.
