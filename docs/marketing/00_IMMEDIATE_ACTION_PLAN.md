## Time Management Tips

### Protect Your Time
- **Block 7 hours/day** for marketing (don't let coding steal this time)
- **9am-12pm**: Deep work (writing, strategy)
- **1pm-4pm**: Execution (posting, emailing, building)
- **4pm-6pm**: Engagement (replies, calls, community)

### Avoid These Traps
1. **Perfectionism**: Done > perfect (iterate fast)
2. **Rabbit holes**: Set timers, stick to plan
3. **Reactive mode**: Check Twitter/email 3× daily max, not constantly
4. **Analysis paralysis**: Make decision in 10 mins or less

### Maintain Momentum
- **Daily wins**: Celebrate small progress
- **Weekly review**: What's working? Double down.
- **Monthly reset**: Prevent burnout, adjust strategy

---

## Emergency Pivot Triggers

**If by Day 15:**
- GitHub stars < 500 → Re-evaluate content strategy, increase engagement
- Discord members < 200 → Host event (hackathon, AMA), direct outreach
- No press interest → Refine pitch, target different outlets
- No enterprise interest → Revisit value prop, improve whitepaper

**Don't panic. Adjust and iterate.**

---

## Support & Resources

### When You Get Stuck
1. **Re-read strategy docs** in this folder
2. **Ask community** (Discord, Twitter)
3. **Study competitors** (what's working for them?)
4. **Take a break** (walk, exercise, clear head)

### External Resources
- **Y Combinator Startup School**: [startup.school](https://startup.school)
- **Lenny's Newsletter**: B2B SaaS marketing tactics
- **Product Hunt**: Study successful launches
- **Indie Hackers**: Solo founder community

---

## Final Pep Talk

**30 days from now, you will:**
- Have 2 published papers with 10K+ views
- Have built a community of 500+ engaged members
- Have conversations with 10+ potential customers
- Have angel investors interested
- Have momentum for Seed raise in 6 months

**This is 100% achievable.**

Sakana AI did it. You have even better foundations (2 papers, not 1).

**The key:**
1. **Execute daily** (consistency > perfection)
2. **Build in public** (share everything)
3. **Engage authentically** (community > marketing)
4. **Track metrics** (what gets measured gets managed)

**Let's go. 🚀**
