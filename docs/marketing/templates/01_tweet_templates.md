### Template 1.2: Key Finding Highlight

```
We analyzed [NUMBER] [THING] and found something surprising:

[PERCENTAGE]% [UNEXPECTED RESULT].

Here's why this matters 🧵👇

[3-5 TWEET THREAD explaining significance]
```

**Example:**
```
We analyzed 100 AI agent failures and found something surprising:

92% failed for the SAME reason.

Here's why this matters 🧵👇

1/ The problem: Goal drift

Agents start with task A, drift to task B, end up at task Z.

Example: "Organize files" → "Rewrite documentation" → "Delete everything"

2/ The root cause: No mathematical convergence

Most agents use heuristics. No proof they'll reach the goal.

Like driving with no GPS, no map, just "head generally north."

3/ Our solution: Distance-to-goal metric

At each step, we calculate: d(current_state, goal_state)

If distance isn't decreasing → something's wrong → intervene.

4/ The results:

Goal drift in traditional agents: 27% of failures
Goal drift in Miyabi: 0%

Math works. 📐

## 3. Thought Leadership Templates

### Template 3.1: Controversial Take

```
Unpopular opinion:

[CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENT]

Here's why I think this (with data): 🧵👇

[5-7 TWEET THREAD with evidence]
```

**Example:**
```
Unpopular opinion:

LLMs will NOT lead to AGI. We need something else entirely.

Here's why I think this (with data): 🧵👇

1/ LLMs are pattern matchers, not reasoners.

They can't:
• Prove theorems (except by memorization)
• Guarantee convergence
• Reason about novel situations

Evidence: GPT-4 fails 40%+ on novel math problems.

2/ AGI requires:
• Formal reasoning (logic, proofs)
• Composable operations (category theory)
• Convergence guarantees (it will finish)

These need symbolic AI + neural nets.

3/ What this means:

We're building the symbolic layer (SWML).
LLMs provide the "understanding."
Together = actually useful agents.

4/ Prediction:

By 2030, AGI = hybrid systems (symbolic + neural).

Pure LLMs will hit a ceiling.

Agree? Disagree? Let's discuss 👇

### Template 3.2: Industry Analysis

```
I analyzed [NUMBER] [THING] in the [INDUSTRY].

Here are [NUMBER] trends you should know:

🧵👇

[THREAD with 1 tweet per trend]
```

**Example:**
```
I analyzed 50 autonomous agent startups.

Here are 3 trends you should know:

🧵👇

1/ Consolidation incoming

15+ "GitHub Copilot competitors"
5+ "Devin clones"

Prediction: 80% will be acquired or die by 2027.

Only survivors: Unique tech moat (like formal proofs).

2/ Enterprise vs Developer split

Some target enterprises ($50K+ contracts).
Others target devs (freemium → $10/mo).

Different GTM, different investors, different outcomes.

We're doing both (open source + enterprise).

3/ Benchmarks will decide winners

SWE-bench is the new ImageNet for coding agents.

Top 10% = fundable.
Top 3 = acquirable at 9-figure valuations.

Currently sitting at top 10%. Aiming for top 3.

Which trend surprises you most? 👇

## 5. Educational Content Templates

### Template 5.1: "How To" Thread

```
How to [ACHIEVE GOAL]:

A thread 🧵👇

[7-10 TWEETS with step-by-step instructions]
```

**Example:**
```
How to build a provably correct AI agent:

A thread 🧵👇

1/ Start with the end

Define success FIRST:
```rust
pub trait Goal {
    fn is_achieved(&self, world: &World) -> bool;
}
```

If you can't define success, you can't build an agent.

2/ Model your world

What can change? Files? Database? API state?
```rust
pub struct World {
    filesystem: FileSystem,
    database: Database,
    apis: HashMap<String, ApiState>,
}
```

3/ Define transformations

How does each action change the world?
```rust
pub trait Transform {
    fn apply(&self, world: World) -> Result<World>;
}
```

4/ Prove convergence

Show mathematically that repeated transformations move toward goal:

d(world_{n+1}, goal) < d(world_n, goal)

### Template 5.2: "Myth vs Reality"

```
Myth: [COMMON MISCONCEPTION]

Reality: [TRUTH]

Let me explain 🧵👇

[3-5 TWEETS explaining with evidence]
```

**Example:**
```
Myth: "AI agents need to be slow to be reliable"

Reality: Miyabi is 2.78× faster AND more reliable than slower alternatives.

Let me explain 🧵👇

1/ Speed ≠ Sloppiness

Slow agents don't "think more carefully."
They just waste time on bad approaches.

Fast agents with good algorithms win.

2/ Our trick: Parallel execution

Break task into independent subtasks.
Run each on separate subagent.
Merge results.

Sequential: 90 seconds
Parallel: 32 seconds

Same reliability. 3× faster.

3/ The math

Convergence rate doesn't depend on speed.
It depends on contraction factor α.

If α < 1, you converge.
Doesn't matter if each step takes 1s or 10s.

4/ Lesson:

Don't trade speed for reliability.
Optimize both.

## Usage Tips

### Daily Posting Schedule

**Monday:** Week kickoff / Announcement
**Tuesday:** Educational thread (How-to)
**Wednesday:** Industry analysis / Thought leadership
**Thursday:** Behind-the-scenes / Founder journey
**Friday:** Community highlight / User showcase
**Weekend:** Engage with others' content (replies, quote tweets)

### Thread Length Guide

**Short threads (3-5 tweets):** Quick takes, myth-busting
**Medium threads (7-10 tweets):** How-tos, analysis
**Long threads (12-15 tweets):** Deep dives, research announcements

### Engagement Optimization

**Best times to post:**
- 9am EST (catches US East Coast morning)
- 1pm EST (lunch break scrolling)
- 5pm EST (after-work commute)

**Avoid:**
- Late nights (< engagement)
- Weekends (unless big announcement)

### Hashtag Strategy

**Use 1-3 hashtags max**

**High-value:**
- #AutonomousAgents
- #AIResearch
- #Rust
- #OpenSource

**Avoid:**
- Generic hashtags (#AI, #Technology) - too broad
- Too many hashtags - looks spammy

## Next Steps

1. **Save this file** for quick reference
2. **Customize templates** with your voice/data
3. **Schedule 1 week ahead** using Buffer or TweetDeck
4. **Track performance** (which templates work best?)
5. **Iterate** (double down on winners, cut losers)
